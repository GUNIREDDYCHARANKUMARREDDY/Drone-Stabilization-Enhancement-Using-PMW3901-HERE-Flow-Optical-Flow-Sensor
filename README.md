# Drone-Stabilization-Enhancement-Using-PMW3901-HERE-Flow-Optical-Flow-Sensor
This project demonstrates how drone stability can be improved using an optical flow sensor (PMW3901/HERE Flow).   The system reduces drift during hover, enhances indoor stability, and makes the drone capable of holding position even without GPS.
